410,2023-05-07 19:21:51+00:00,@flypie This would be amazing for Liverpool! I’m sure @MetroMayorSteve is working behind the scenes to look at the possibility. Just shows what #Eurovision2023 could bring as a legacy.
411,2023-05-07 19:20:24+00:00,"Translation:

Swedish star Loreen (from eurodance smash hit “Euphoria”) continues to establish herself as the overwhelming favorites to win Eurovision 2023, while the UK has recently slipped to tenth place among the favourites.

With the recent start of rehearsals for the 67th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest in Liverpool, Loreen remains the favorite to win the contest, according to the Eurovision World tracker. Nearly a month after the latest odds analyses, Loreen is currently the favorite to win by a considerable margin, with the betting public continuing to support the Swedish singer.

It is important to note that over the last month, support for Spanish and French holdings has increased. Spain became the 4th favourite, while France gained four places and is now the 6th favourite. On the other hand, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom have dropped to the bottom of the top ten."

Liverpool pupils celebrate being 'The Class of Eurovision 2023'
BY SARA TILLEY
EUROVISION FUN: 27 school projects across Liverpool City Region have received funding
Eurovision-themed chess pieces, a Beatles singalong and Ukrainian sunflower artworks are among the 27 school projects across Merseyside which have received EuruoGrant funding to celebrate the Eurovision Song Contest 2023.
The projects form part of the host city’s EuroLearn programme which provides a unique opportunity for schools – and non-school educational settings – to celebrate all things Eurovision with their own events.
Schools across Liverpool, Wirral, Sefton, Halton, St Helens and Knowsley were invited to apply for grants of up to £2,000 to get into the Eurovision spirit by hosting events that celebrate the competition itself, the relationship with our friends in Ukraine and the wider European heritage in Liverpool.
Among the successful schools is Our Lady of Compassion Catholic Primary School, in Formby. Each class will represent a country taking part in this year’s contest and will be responsible for making local delicacies from their country which will be shared at a European street food market.
Early years and infant pupils will learn and perform a Eurovision song from their designated country, whilst juniors will compose and perform an original song. The whole school will also perform ‘‘We All Live In A Blue And Yellow Submarine” to unite Liverpool and Ukraine through music.
The project will teach the children about other cultures through cooking and music, but there will be a specific focus on learning about traditional Ukrainian customs. The school’s Ukrainian teaching assistant will share symbols of Ukraine, such as the traditional clothing, flag and vinochok (flower crown).
Want more news? Then you'll want our sister site
Teacher Rachel Farrell said: “We are delighted to have received EuroGrant funding to realise our ideas. We want children to understand the significance of such a weird and wonderful event being held in our city and appreciate that this truly is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The opportunity to celebrate a contest that is based on individuality and celebrating diversity will be incredible for our pupils.”
The school will also be running art workshops based on the Ukrainian national flower, the sunflower, to create Van Gogh inspired paintings and a collaborative mural. Each child will adding their own petal with their name, to create a lasting legacy of ‘The Class of Eurovision 2023.’

➡️ The BBC's cinematography is very good, but falls short as several cameras, especially the unmanned one at the front of the satellite stage, are in shot too often.  If you can film the previous Monarch's send-off in Westminster & Windsor without any other camera getting in the way, you can do that here.  Indeed, we do have multicam directors who worked on that very funeral. 

➡️ That said, the versatility of this year's set is just wonderful.  The BBC have that bit right.

➡️ Oh, Sweden 🇸🇪.  It looks like a live on tape, like it's being piped in from a different studio.  But it did on Melodifestivalen too.  I appreciate that SVT will have sent the BBC the CuePilot script & gone ""adapt that"" but I feel something is lost.

➡️ Ireland are NQing.

➡️ Finland look like a genuine contender.

➡️ Way too much novelty on show this year.  Juries have to come back for semis."

19108,2023-05-18 19:30:42+00:00,"@ProfessorGlaw @jepannell I think an average cap of 5 remotes a day is fine. But, now I think of it because of your response, I think they should be able to carry over max 1 day. So you can have 10 on Wednesdays Raid Hours. Remote prices should be more reasonable too, Imo 125-150 is pretty fair."

19111,2023-05-18 19:22:32+00:00,@jepannell @ProfessorGlaw But still a lot less than doing all remotely.
19112,2023-05-18 19:20:31+00:00,"@instinct2006 @ProfessorGlaw @MichaelSteranka It's more the fact of 'overraiding' which made Legendaries too common.

Not the people who remote because of no other choice. The cap isn't really an issue here, but the bizarre price increase of remotes is."
19113,2023-05-18 19:17:54+00:00,@ProfessorGlaw Legendaries became as easy to get as Pidgey. Ok wrong example the past months. Should say Yungoos instead of Pidgey now ;)

Now we do it more relaxed and depending on which gyms have a T5 we do 4-5.

If we  choose another starting point and all would have a T5 I think we can hit 15 if we want to."
